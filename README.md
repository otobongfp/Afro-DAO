# Afro-DAO
A community DAO for funding projects SDS &amp; MDG related projects across the African Continent.

A DAO
Build a Smart Contract where different addresses can send funds into.

//HOW IT WORKS
//The Funds are then meant to fund certain activities.
//So people can create a Proposal to get funds.
//The Proposal provides a few details :
//	Name of Proposal
//	Short Description
//	Amount in Ethers(Although this would have to be translated to the equivalent in our token)
//	Wallet address of Proposer

//HOW PROPOSAL IS DONE
//The Proposals can then be voted for by stakeholders in the community.
//The Stakeholders are verified addresses.
//Once more that 60% of the stakeholder have voted
//The proposal enters into the next stage where it is to be voted for by the Community.
//Once it is voted for by more than 50% of the community
//The funds requested is released from the contract to fund the address that requested for support.
//And the proposal is Finalized and Removed from List of Proposals

//To contribute to wallet holdings you need to use our Token.
//We have a feature that allows you to swap your holdings for our Token, the Token is then used to fund projects.
//The Proposals are centred around supporting women empowerment initiatives, entrepreneurs, etc to help them get started
