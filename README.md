# Afro-DAO
A community DAO for funding projects SDS &amp; MDG related projects across the African Continent.

A DAO
Build a Smart Contract where different addresses can send funds into.
The major parts of the contract is a voting contract and subsequently another contract to uniquely handle funds request.

The idea behind this smart contract is to enable different unique individuals/organisations especially non-profits to make proposals to seek for funds. Registered addressed on the nextwork who own a certain number of tokens can then vote for these proposals.

Once the proposal has amassed a number of vote greater than atleast 60% of the community then the funds can be made available in form of tokens to the proposer.
